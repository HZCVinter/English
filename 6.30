Dear Jack,
I’m very glad to know that you are interested in the changes in Ganzhou. Let me tell you some of the developments during the past few years. 
I have witnessed many great changes in my city. The most impressive one is the rapid development of transportation. In the past, people travelled mainly by bus. Nowadays, with more and more city roads and railways built, it is much faster and more convenient for people to go almost everywhere. Additionally, the spread of public bikes helps people travel any distance more easily. All these couldn’t have happened without the measures taken by the government and applications of new technology.
I enjoy these conveniences every day and feel proud of my city. I am confident that Ganzhou will become more liveable in the future. Just come and have a look yourself!
Yours,
Li Hua
